Using this Add-on
-----------------------------------
* Prerequisites:
    - An index "barracuda_spamfw" must exist and must be searchable by
      the user required.
        > To use a different index, copy the first "barracuda_email" eventtype 
          from $splunkhome/etc/apps/TA-barracuda-spamfw/default/eventtypes.conf
          to   $splunkhome/etc/apps/TA-barracuda-spamfw/local/eventtypes.conf
          and change the index=barracuda_spamfw to your own index.
        > An example of the file that would be required is shown below.
    - Populate the index with an input tagged with sourcetype "barracuda:spamfw"
        > See below for a sample monitor stanza for using a UF on a 
          sylog-receiving server (syslog-ng or rsyslog).

* Installation
    - Untar on search head directly, deploy from app store, or deploy via
      your favorite (and tested) deployment method.
    - Restart Splunk.


Sample $splunkhome/etc/apps/TA-barracuda-spamfw/local/eventtypes.conf
